# Lab 04 – User Management & File Permissions

## Objective
Understand how Linux manages users, groups, file ownership, and permissions.

## Environment
- Host: MacBook (Apple Silicon)
- Hypervisor: UTM
- Guest OS: Kali Linux

## Activities Performed

### 1. User Creation
- Created a new user named `labuser`.
- Assigned a password during setup.

### 2. Sudo Privileges
- Added `labuser` to the `sudo` group.
- Verified group membership using:
  - `groups labuser`
  - `id labuser`
- Confirmed sudo access by running a sudo command as `labuser`.

### 3. File Permission Testing
- Switched to `labuser`.
- Created a file named `secure.txt`.
- Checked default permissions using `ls -l`.

### 4. Modified Permissions
- Changed permissions using:
  - `chmod 600 secure.txt`
  - `chmod 777 secure.txt`
- Observed how permissions affected access.

### 5. Directory Access Control
- Attempted to access `/home/labuser` from another user.
- Received “Permission denied”.
- Confirmed Linux restricts access to user home directories by default.

## Key Learnings

- Linux controls access using users and groups.
- `sudo` provides temporary administrative privileges.
- File permissions use read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
- `chmod` changes file permissions.
- `chown` changes file ownership.
- Directory permissions affect whether a user can access files inside.
- Root can bypass permission restrictions.

## Result

Successfully practiced Linux user management and file permission control inside Kali Linux VM.
